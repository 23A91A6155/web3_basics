Web3 and Blockchain Basics: Setup Wallet and Explore DApps
Reflection on Web3 Basics:
In this Web3 practical, I learned how to use blockchain technology in a hands-on way by working with MetaMask and the Ethereum Sepolia test network. This activity helped me understand the core process of creating and using a digital wallet, connecting to a test network, and making a blockchain transaction step by step.
I started by installing the MetaMask browser extension and setting up my wallet securely. I carefully saved my seed phrase offline, as it is the only way to recover the wallet if access is lost. After setting up, I enabled the Sepolia Test Network in MetaMask to work with test ETH instead of real cryptocurrency. I then received test SepoliaETH from a faucet, which provides free tokens for learning and testing purposes.
Once my wallet was funded, I explored how blockchain transactions work. I used the ‚ÄúSend‚Äù option in MetaMask to transfer 0.001 SepoliaETH from (Akhila) to Account 2. The transaction took only a few seconds to process and was marked as ‚ÄúConfirmed.‚Äù I then viewed the details on Etherscan, the blockchain explorer, which showed the transaction hash, gas fee, and status. Seeing the transaction recorded permanently on the blockchain helped me clearly understand how decentralized systems store and verify data publicly.
This experience gave me practical exposure to key Web3 concepts such as wallets, gas fees, smart contracts, and public verification. The main challenge I faced was understanding how gas fees are calculated and why transactions sometimes take time to confirm. However, after exploring Etherscan and checking the gas details in MetaMask, I understood how blockchain nodes validate transactions.
Overall, this exercise helped me build confidence in using blockchain tools and understand the difference between traditional banking systems and decentralized blockchain technology. I now feel more comfortable interacting with DApps and using wallets for future blockchain projects.



Web3 Basics ‚Äî Technical Summary
Name: Akhila
Network Used: Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
Wallet Used: MetaMask

1. Introduction
The Web3 Basics activity helped me understand how blockchain technology, wallets, and decentralized applications (DApps) work together. In this task, I learned how to create a blockchain wallet using MetaMask, connect to the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet, receive free test ETH from a faucet, make a transaction, and verify it on Etherscan. Through this process, I gained practical knowledge of how real blockchain transactions are executed and recorded publicly on the blockchain.
2. Installing MetaMask and Creating Wallet
The first step was to install the MetaMask browser extension from the official website https://metamask.io. After installing it, I created a new wallet by clicking on ‚ÄúCreate a Wallet‚Äù. I then set a strong password and was given a 12-word secret recovery phrase (also called a seed phrase). I wrote this phrase down on paper and stored it safely offline because it is the only way to recover the wallet if access is lost.
Once the setup was complete, MetaMask opened my wallet dashboard, showing Account 1 (Akhila) along with a unique public wallet address starting with ‚Äú0x‚Ä¶‚Äù. This address acts like an account number that can be shared publicly for receiving ETH or tokens.
3. Adding the Ethereum Sepolia Test Network
By default, MetaMask connects to the Ethereum Mainnet, where real ETH is used. Since we needed free test ETH, I enabled Test Networks from MetaMask‚Äôs Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí ‚ÄúShow Test Networks.‚Äù
Then, I switched to Sepolia Test Network from the dropdown list. This allows interaction with a blockchain that behaves like Ethereum Mainnet but uses test ETH, which has no real value.
After switching, the top of my MetaMask wallet displayed ‚ÄúSepolia Test Network‚Äù, confirming that all future transactions would take place on the test blockchain.

4. Getting Test ETH from a Faucet
To perform transactions, I needed some test ETH. For that, I visited the Alchemy Sepolia Faucet website. On the page, I pasted my MetaMask wallet address (copied from the ‚ÄúAccount 1 (Akhila)‚Äù section) and requested ETH.
After waiting a few seconds, I received confirmation, and the test ETH appeared in my MetaMask balance. This step simulated how users fund their wallets with real ETH in actual blockchain use cases.

5. Making a Test Transaction
With test ETH in my wallet, I clicked the ‚ÄúSend‚Äù button in MetaMask.
I pasted another wallet address (Account 2) as the recipient and entered 0.001 SepoliaETH as the amount to transfer. Then I confirmed the transaction.
Within a few seconds, the transaction changed from ‚ÄúPending‚Äù to ‚ÄúConfirmed.‚Äù This demonstrated how blockchain transactions are validated and permanently recorded through miners or validators.

6. Verifying on Etherscan
MetaMask provided a link to view the transaction on Etherscan, which is a blockchain explorer for Ethereum and test networks. On the Etherscan page, I could see:
‚Ä¢	The Transaction Hash (TxHash)
‚Ä¢	The Block Number
‚Ä¢	The Sender and Receiver Addresses
‚Ä¢	The Gas Fee (the small cost for processing the transaction)
‚Ä¢	The Transaction Status: Success
This verification proved that the transaction was truly completed on the blockchain and is permanently visible to anyone ‚Äî showing the transparency of Web3 technology.

7. Screenshots Collected
Throughout the process, I took the following screenshots as proof of work:
1.	MetaMask wallet home screen showing Account 1 (Akhila).
2.	Sepolia test network selected in MetaMask.
3.	Alchemy faucet transaction confirmation.
4.	MetaMask ‚ÄúSend‚Äù transaction page.
5.	Etherscan transaction details page.
These images document each step of the Web3 activity and show successful blockchain interaction.

8. Learning Outcomes
Through this task, I learned:
‚Ä¢	How to create and secure a crypto wallet.
‚Ä¢	The difference between Mainnet and Testnet.
‚Ä¢	How faucets are used to obtain free tokens for testing.
‚Ä¢	How blockchain transactions are transparent, verifiable, and immutable.
‚Ä¢	How Etherscan helps verify all blockchain records.
This exercise gave me hands-on understanding of how decentralized applications interact with wallets and networks ‚Äî the foundation of all Web3 technologies.
